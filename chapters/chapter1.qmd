**R Plot Function**

**In this article, you will learn to use the plot function in R programming with the help of examples.**

The most used plotting function in R programming is the `plot()` function. It is a generic function, meaning, it has many methods which are called according to the type of object passed to `plot()`.

In the simplest case, we can pass in a vector and get a scatter plot of magnitude vs index. But generally, we pass in two vectors, and a scatter plot of these points is plotted.

For example, the command `plot(c(1,2),c(3,5))` would plot the points `(1,3)` and `(2,5)`.

Here is a more concrete example where we plot a sine function ranging from `-pi` to `pi`.

```{r}
x <- seq(-pi,pi,0.1)
plot(x, sin(x),
main="Overlaying Graphs",
ylab="",
type="l",
col="blue")
lines(x,cos(x), col="red")
legend("topleft",
c("sin(x)","cos(x)"),
fill=c("blue","red")
)
```
